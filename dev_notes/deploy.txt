1) Build the project on local machine:

yarn build

2) Copy up to a staging directory on ec2.  You can't directly copy to the apache dir due to security.

a) clear out the dummy directory first.
Note: you basically cannot do "overlay" copies.  You need to remove the prior verion of the IW contents.

cd ~/resources/tmp/dummy
rm -rf *

b) scp -rp -i /home/vturner/vtstuff/cloud/am-ec2/key_pairs/am-ec2_key_pair_2018-05-02.pem * ubuntu@infinitewheelie.org:/home/ubuntu/resources/tmp/dummy

3) copy from here into /var/www/html:

a) clear out everything from $VRGAL_DEPLOY except for the apps dir:

i) sudo rm asset-manifest.json favicon.ico index.html manifest.json precache-manifest.* service-worker.js

ii) sudo rm -rf html/ img/ libs/ static/


b)
cd ~/resource/tmp/dummp

sudo cp -rp * $VRGAL_DEPLOY

Note: VRGal is staged under '$VRGAL_DEPLOY/apps/vrgal' (not to be confused with the web site intro page is at $VRGAL_DEPLOY/html/apps).  Everything else under '/var/www/html' belongs exclusively to this 'static' react app.
